# BEA - Beautiful Flexible

Transform ACF's flexible layouts list into a nice and UX popup. 

![Screenshot Before/After Beautiful Flexible](.wordpress.org/screenshot.png)

# How ?

By default there is a "default" image for layouts. But the idea is to customize them by adding your own.

## Image convention

* The size of image should be 366 x 150 or bigger 732 x 300.
* They should be named based on the flexible key (`push_2_light`) with no underscores but dashes (`push-2-light.png`).

## Where images should be situated

They should more likely be situated into your theme `wp-content\themes\my-theme\assets\bea-beautiful-flexible\`. But if you have a child-theme and added images into it, these will overwrite those from parent-theme.

Also note that you can filter this path to gather all your images into a same folder :

`add_filter( 'bea.beautiful_flexible.images_path', $path );`

Finally, you could filter all images like this :

`add_filter( 'bea.beautiful_flexible.images', $images );`
